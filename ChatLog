mhood112: A.	Filter the dataset so that it only shows only the NBA regular season data.
B.	Using this filtered dataset, determine the player who has played the most regular seasons.


Workspace: Collecting workspace informationFiltering to most relevant informationTo achieve the tasks, you can use the `pandas` library in Python. Here is a step-by-step guide:

### A. Filter the dataset to show only NBA regular season data

1. Load the dataset using `pandas`.
2. Filter the dataset to include only rows where the `League` is "NBA" and the `Stage` is "Regular_Season".

### B. Determine the player who has played the most regular seasons

1. Group the filtered dataset by `Player`.
2. Count the number of unique `Season` entries for each player.
3. Identify the player with the highest count.

Here is the complete code to perform these tasks:

```python
import pandas as pd

# Load the dataset
file_path = '/Users/miahood/Desktop/assignment 4/players_stats_by_season_full_details.csv'
df = pd.read_csv(file_path)

# Filter the dataset for NBA regular season data
nba_regular_season_df = df[(df['League'] == 'NBA') & (df['Stage'] == 'Regular_Season')]

# Group by player and count the number of unique seasons
player_season_counts = nba_regular_season_df.groupby('Player')['Season'].nunique()

# Find the player with the most regular seasons
most_regular_seasons_player = player_season_counts.idxmax()
most_regular_seasons_count = player_season_counts.max()

print(f"The player who has played the most regular seasons is {most_regular_seasons_player} with {most_regular_seasons_count} seasons.")
```

This code will output the player who has played the most regular seasons along with the number of seasons they played. Make sure you have the `pandas` library installed in your environment. If not, you can install it using:

```sh
pip install pandas
```

mhood112: use a different way to use the csv

GitHub Copilot: You can use the `csv` module in Python to read and process the CSV file. Here is an alternative approach using the `csv` module:

```python
import csv
from collections import defaultdict

# Load the dataset
file_path = '/Users/miahood/Desktop/assignment 4/players_stats_by_season_full_details.csv'

# Initialize a dictionary to count the number of unique seasons for each player
player_season_counts = defaultdict(set)

# Read the CSV file
with open(file_path, mode='r') as file:
    reader = csv.DictReader(file)
    for row in reader:
        if row['League'] == 'NBA' and row['Stage'] == 'Regular_Season':
            player_season_counts[row['Player']].add(row['Season'])

# Find the player with the most regular seasons
most_regular_seasons_player = max(player_season_counts, key=lambda player: len(player_season_counts[player]))
most_regular_seasons_count = len(player_season_counts[most_regular_seasons_player])

print(f"The player who has played the most regular seasons is {most_regular_seasons_player} with {most_regular_seasons_count} seasons.")
```

This code uses the `csv` module to read the CSV file and a `defaultdict` to count the number of unique seasons for each player. It then finds the player with the most regular seasons and prints the result.

mhood112: use os to input the csv

GitHub Copilot: You can use the `os` module to dynamically construct the file path. Here is the updated code:

```python
import pandas as pd
import os

# Construct the file path using os
base_path = '/Users/miahood/Desktop/assignment 4'
file_name = 'players_stats_by_season_full_details.csv'
file_path = os.path.join(base_path, file_name)

# Load the dataset
df = pd.read_csv(file_path)

# Filter the dataset for NBA regular season data
nba_regular_season_df = df[(df['League'] == 'NBA') & (df['Stage'] == 'Regular_Season')]

# Group by player and count the number of unique seasons
player_season_counts = nba_regular_season_df.groupby('Player')['Season'].nunique()

# Find the player with the most regular seasons
most_regular_seasons_player = player_season_counts.idxmax()
most_regular_seasons_count = player_season_counts.max()

print(f"The player who has played the most regular seasons is {most_regular_seasons_player} with {most_regular_seasons_count} seasons.")
```

This code uses the `os.path.join` method to construct the file path, making it more flexible and portable.

mhood112: us another way to input the csv

GitHub Copilot: You can use the `os` module to dynamically construct the file path and the `csv` module to read the CSV file. Here is the updated code:

```python
import os
import csv
from collections import defaultdict

# Construct the file path using os
base_path = '/Users/miahood/Desktop/assignment 4'
file_name = 'players_stats_by_season_full_details.csv'
file_path = os.path.join(base_path, file_name)

# Initialize a dictionary to count the number of unique seasons for each player
player_season_counts = defaultdict(set)

# Read the CSV file
with open(file_path, mode='r') as file:
    reader = csv.DictReader(file)
    for row in reader:
        if row['League'] == 'NBA' and row['Stage'] == 'Regular_Season':
            player_season_counts[row['Player']].add(row['Season'])

# Find the player with the most regular seasons
most_regular_seasons_player = max(player_season_counts, key=lambda player: len(player_season_counts[player]))
most_regular_seasons_count = len(player_season_counts[most_regular_seasons_player])

print(f"The player who has played the most regular seasons is {most_regular_seasons_player} with {most_regular_seasons_count} seasons.")
```

This code uses the `os.path.join` method to construct the file path and the `csv` module to read the CSV file. It then processes the data to find the player with the most regular seasons.

mhood112: load the csv into this file

GitHub Copilot: To load the CSV file using the `os` module in your existing Python script, you can modify the code as follows:

```python
import pandas as pd
import os

# Construct the file path using os
base_path = '/Users/miahood/Desktop/assignment 4'
file_name = 'players_stats_by_season_full_details.csv'
file_path = os.path.join(base_path, file_name)

# Load the dataset
df = pd.read_csv(file_path)

# Filter the dataset for NBA regular season data
nba_regular_season_df = df[(df['League'] == 'NBA') & (df['Stage'] == 'Regular_Season')]

# Group by player and count the number of unique seasons
player_season_counts = nba_regular_season_df.groupby('Player')['Season'].nunique()

# Find the player with the most regular seasons
most_regular_seasons_player = player_season_counts.idxmax()
most_regular_seasons_count = player_season_counts.max()

print(f"The player who has played the most regular seasons is {most_regular_seasons_player} with {most_regular_seasons_count} seasons.")
```

This code uses the `os.path.join` method to construct the file path, making it more flexible and portable.

mhood112: avoid hardcoded file paths, making your script portable and user-friendly

GitHub Copilot: To make your script more portable and user-friendly, you can use the `os` module to dynamically construct the file path and allow the user to specify the base directory. Here is the updated code:

```python
import pandas as pd
import os
import numpy as np
import scipy.stats as stats

# Define the base path (you can change this to any directory you want)
base_path = os.path.expanduser('~/Desktop/assignment 4')
file_name = 'players_stats_by_season_full_details.csv'
file_path = os.path.join(base_path, file_name)

# Load the dataset
df = pd.read_csv(file_path)

# Filter the dataset for NBA regular season data
nba_regular_season_df = df[(df['League'] == 'NBA') & (df['Stage'] == 'Regular_Season')]

# Group by player and count the number of unique seasons
player_season_counts = nba_regular_season_df.groupby('Player')['Season'].nunique()

# Find the player with the most regular seasons
most_regular_seasons_player = player_season_counts.idxmax()
most_regular_seasons_count = player_season_counts.max()

print(f"The player who has played the most regular seasons is {most_regular_seasons_player} with {most_regular_seasons_count} seasons.")
```

In this script:
- The `base_path` is set to the user's Desktop directory, making it easy to change if needed.
- The `os.path.expanduser` function is used to ensure the path works on different systems by expanding the `~` to the user's home directory.
- The `os.path.join` method is used to construct the file path, making it more flexible and portable.

mhood112: C.	Calculate this player's three point accuracy for each season that they played.

GitHub Copilot: To calculate the player's three-point accuracy for each season they played, you can follow these steps:

1. Filter the dataset to include only the rows for the player with the most regular seasons.
2. Calculate the three-point accuracy for each season by dividing the number of three-point field goals made (3PM) by the number of three-point field goals attempted (3PA).

Here is the updated code to include this calculation:

```python
import pandas as pd
import os
import numpy as np
import scipy.stats as stats

# Define the base path (you can change this to any directory you want)
base_path = os.path.expanduser('~/Desktop/assignment 4')
file_name = 'players_stats_by_season_full_details.csv'
file_path = os.path.join(base_path, file_name)

# Load the dataset
df = pd.read_csv(file_path)

# Filter the dataset for NBA regular season data
nba_regular_season_df = df[(df['League'] == 'NBA') & (df['Stage'] == 'Regular_Season')]

# Group by player and count the number of unique seasons
player_season_counts = nba_regular_season_df.groupby('Player')['Season'].nunique()

# Find the player with the most regular seasons
most_regular_seasons_player = player_season_counts.idxmax()
most_regular_seasons_count = player_season_counts.max()

print(f"The player who has played the most regular seasons is {most_regular_seasons_player} with {most_regular_seasons_count} seasons.")

# Filter the dataset for the player with the most regular seasons
player_data = nba_regular_season_df[nba_regular_season_df['Player'] == most_regular_seasons_player]

# Calculate three-point accuracy for each season
player_data['3P_accuracy'] = player_data['3PM'] / player_data['3PA']

# Print the three-point accuracy for each season
print(f"Three-point accuracy for {most_regular_seasons_player} by season:")
print(player_data[['Season', '3PM', '3PA', '3P_accuracy']])
```

This code will:
1. Filter the dataset to include only the rows for the player with the most regular seasons.
2. Calculate the three-point accuracy for each season by dividing the number of three-point field goals made (3PM) by the number of three-point field goals attempted (3PA).
3. Print the three-point accuracy for each season.

mhood112: Perform a linear regression for their three point accuracy across the yaers played, and create a line of best fit.

GitHub Copilot: To perform a linear regression on the player's three-point accuracy across the years they played and create a line of best fit, you can use the `scipy.stats` module for the regression and `matplotlib` for plotting. Here is the updated code:

```python

plt.title(f'Three-Point Accuracy Over Seasons for {most_regular_seasons_player}')
plt.legend()
plt.xticks(rotation=45)
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```

This code will:
1. Filter the dataset to include only the rows for the player with the most regular seasons.
2. Calculate the three-point accuracy for each season.
3. Perform a linear regression on the three-point accuracy across the years played.
4. Create a line of best fit.

mhood112: Calculate the average three point accuracy by integrating the fit line over the played seasons and dividing by the number difference in played seasons (lastest season - earliest season). How does this value compared to the actual average number of 3-pointers made by this player?

GitHub Copilot: To calculate the average three-point accuracy by integrating the fit line over the played seasons and comparing it to the actual average number of three-pointers made by the player, you can follow these steps:

1. Integrate the fit line over the played seasons.
2. Divide the integral by the difference in played seasons to get the average three-point accuracy from the fit line.
3. Calculate the actual average three-point accuracy.
4. Compare the two values.

Here is the updated code to perform these calculations:

This code will:
1. Calculate the mean, variance, skew, and kurtosis for the Field Goals Made (FGM) column.
2. Calculate the mean, variance, skew, and kurtosis for the Field Goals Attempted (FGA) column.
3. Print the statistical metrics for both FGM and FGA.
4. Compare the statistics from FGM to FGA and print the differences.

mhood112: Perform a relational t-test on Field Goals Made (FGM) and Field Goals Attempted (FGA) columns. Addittionally, perform a regular t-test on the FGM and FGA columns individually. How to these results of the individual t-test compared to the t-test run for the two related samples together?

GitHub Copilot: To perform a paired t-test on the Field Goals Made (FGM) and Field Goals Attempted (FGA) columns, as well as individual t-tests on each column, you can use the `scipy.stats` module. Here is the updated code to include these tests and compare the results:
